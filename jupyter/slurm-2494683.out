If you are working in NYU campus, please open an iTerm window, run command

ssh -L 9908:localhost:9908 jmw784@prince.hpc.nyu.edu

If you are working off campus, you should already have ssh tunneling setup through HPC bastion host, 
that you can directly login to prince with command

ssh jmw784@prince

Please open an iTerm window, run command

ssh -L 9908:localhost:9908 jmw784@prince

Step 2:

Keep the iTerm windows in the previouse step open. Now open browser, find the line with

The Jupyter Notebook is running at: c30-08

the URL is something: http://localhost:9908/?token=XXXXXXXX (see your token below)
